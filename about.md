title: About my research
---

 I use statistical and behavioral methods to study how people see in the natural environment. Specifically, I'm interested in how we see things that are out of focus, and how we detect objects in the environment.

## Detecting blur in the nature

The natural environment contains objects at many distances, but the human eye can focus light from only one distance at a time. Because of this much of light that falls on the retinae is blurry. 


## Detecting patterns in nature

Detecting objects in cluttered scenes is one of the most basic and fundemental visual tasks.
